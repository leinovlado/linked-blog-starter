The Kellogg Logic Model is a framework used by the W.K. Kellogg Foundation to guide its program planning, implementation, and evaluation processes. It is a visual representation of the theory of change underlying a program or initiative, and it helps to clarify the intended outcomes and the strategies to achieve them.

The Kellogg Logic Model consists of four main components:

1. Inputs: This includes the resources, such as funding, staff, and partnerships, that are necessary for the program to operate.

1. Activities: These are the specific actions or interventions that the program will undertake to achieve its goals. Activities can include training sessions, workshops, community outreach, and policy advocacy.

1. Outputs: These are the immediate results or products of the program activities. Outputs can include the number of people trained, the number of workshops conducted, or the number of policy briefs produced.

1. Outcomes: These are the changes or benefits that result from the program activities. Outcomes can be short-term, intermediate, or long-term. Short-term outcomes may include increased knowledge or skills, while intermediate outcomes may include changes in behavior or attitudes. Long-term outcomes are the ultimate goals of the program, such as improved health outcomes or reduced poverty rates.

1. Impacts: is the long-term and sustainable change or benefit that occurs as a result of a program or initiative. It represents the ultimate goal or desired outcome that the program aims to achieve. Impact is often measured by assessing the broader societal or systemic changes that occur as a result of the program's activities and outcomes. It can include improvements in social, economic, or environmental conditions, as well as changes in policies or practices at a larger scale. Impact is typically evaluated over a longer period of time and may require ongoing monitoring and assessment to determine its extent and sustainability.

The Kellogg Logic Model also includes a feedback loop, which allows for ongoing monitoring and evaluation of the program. This feedback loop helps to ensure that the program is on track and making progress towards its intended outcomes.

Overall, the Kellogg Logic Model provides a systematic and structured approach to program planning and evaluation, and it helps to ensure that programs are designed and implemented in a strategic and effective manner.
