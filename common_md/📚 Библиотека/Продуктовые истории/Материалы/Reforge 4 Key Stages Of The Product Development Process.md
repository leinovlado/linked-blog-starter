As product managers, we're constantly building, launching, and iterating on products, features, and use cases. Along the way, we make a sequence of decisions about what to build, how to build, and how to improve and iterate on our features and products.

Since these decisions build on each other, it's important to understand what assumptions we're operating under, what facts we already have, and what past decisions we've already made.

We can broadly classify these decisions into four phases of the product development process:

1. [**Opportunity Validation**](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-development-process#Product-Development-Phase-1-Opportunity-Validation)

1. [**Design**](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-development-process#Product-Development-Phase-2-Design)

1. [**Development**](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-development-process#Product-Development-Phase-3-Development)

1. [**Launch & Iteration**](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-development-process#Product-Development-Phase-4-Launch-Iteration)

Most product and feature work tends to go through these stages of the development process, often in a linear fashion. While there are exceptions, these stages of the product development process provide a good mental model to evaluate and classify decisions.

Two long-time experts in product, Jiaona Zhang the VP of Product at Webflow and Anand Subramani the SVP of Product at Path, helped create this four-part framework that can provide even the aspirational product manager with a strong understanding of what product development is and the [role the product manager plays in the process.](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/what-does-a-product-manager-do)

Both of these Reforge Experts have over **15 years of experience as** [**product leaders**](https://www.reforge.com/programs/product-leadership) and mentors at multi-billion dollar companies like Zynga, Gusto, Dropbox, Pilot, Webflow, Airbnb, and WeWork.

Here, we’ll walk through the four key phases, or steps, of the product development process. We’ll dig deeper to see what it really means to be successful at each phase, and we’ll consider the role of the product manager and their cross-functional counterparts.
