## Product Manager Skill Set 2: Customer Insight

The second category of skills that define the [work of a product manager](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/what-does-a-product-manager-do) is **customer insight.** As the name suggests, this is all about a product manager’s capacity for understanding their customer! They should empathize with them, anticipate their customers’ existing and future needs, and communicate those needs to the rest of the team. The three customer insight competencies are **fluency with data**, **voice of the customer**, and **user experience design**.

* **Skill 4: Fluency with data** is when a product manager can generate actionable data-based insights, which they can leverage to achieve product goals, and connect those goals to larger business goals.

* **Skill 5: Voice of the customer** is when a product manager leverages user feedback in all forms, from casual conversations to formal studies. While data is enormously useful for tracking customer behaviors, great product managers know they need to actually talk to customers to deeply understand their nuanced interests and concerns.

* **Skill 6: User experience design** is when a product manager defines requirements and delivers designs that are easy to use.

## Product Manager Skill Set 3: Product Strategy

The third category of product manager skills in the Competency Model is **product strategy.** We define [product strategy](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-strategy-guide) as a targeted, long-term view of how product development achieves a company's long-term vision.

* **Skill 8: Product vision and roadmapping** is a product manager’s capacity for defining an overall [vision for the product](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-vision). A peak product manager can create a clear [product roadmap](https://www.reforge.com/previews/product/product-roadmaps) of prioritized features and initiatives that work toward that broader vision.

* **Skill 9: Strategic impact** is when a product manager understands and contributes to the business strategy for the team and company overall.

## Product Manager Skill Set 4: Influencing People

Product management requires fostering strong relationships with cross-functional peers and leadership, and eventually, building and leading product management teams. This category is all about what it means to lead, at a variety of levels in a multitude of ways. The three skills in this category are **stakeholder management**, **team leadership**, and **managing up**.

* **Skill 10: Stakeholder management** is a product manager’s ability to proactively factor the needs of stakeholders into key product decisions.

* **Skill 11: Team leadership** is when a product manager can manage and mentor direct reports, guide them towards successful product delivery, and work with them as they strive to achieve their career objectives.

* **Skill 12: Managing up** — which we define differently than some — is the ability to leverage senior members of the organization to help product managers achieve their goals, deliver meaningful business outcomes, and positively influence the strategic direction of the team and company overall.
